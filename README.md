Experienced RF Design Engineer with a passion for the aerospace industry. With a background in Electronic Engineering and a strong focus on RF technology, I have been actively involved in designing and analyzing RF electronic equipment for satellite communications ðŸ›°.

During my tenure at INVAP, a leading aerospace company, I have played a crucial role in the design and analysis of RF equipment, specifically in the development of K/Ka-band Down/Up-converters for SmallGeo SATCOM. I have also successfully designed parallel coupled filters at Ka-band frequencies, contributing to the flexible payload development of GSATCOM.

With a Master's thesis focused on the design, implementation, and characterization of an analog front-end for a general-purpose UWB receiver, I possess in-depth knowledge of RF systems and have hands-on experience with tools such as ADS, CST, Genesys, Spice, and Altium Designer.

Furthermore, my experience as an Electromagnetism Teaching Assistant at the University of Buenos Aires allowed me to deepen my understanding of Maxwell equations, microwave technology, transmission lines, and antennas.

In addition to my RF expertise, I have developed a keen interest in Software Defined Radio (SDR) and its applications. I actively explore this field through personal projects and continuous learning. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my RF background to contribute to the advancement of SDR technology and its integration into cutting-edge communication systems.

Driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to excellence, I am a dedicated professional with a strong problem-solving mindset and a collaborative approach. I thrive in challenging environments and continuously strive for personal and professional growth ðŸš€.
