🛰 Experienced RF Design Engineer passionate about the aerospace industry. I have been actively involved in the design and analysis of RF electronic equipment for satellite communications. During my time at INVAP, a leading aerospace company, I am playing a crucial role in the design and analysis of RF equipment, specifically in the development of a K/Ka-band up-converter and down-converter for the Flexible Payload of a SmallGeo SATCOM. I have also designed parallel coupled filters at Ka-band frequencies, contributing to the development of the GSATCOM's Flexible Payload.

🎓 In my Master's thesis focused on the design, implementation, and characterization of a general-purpose UWB receiver, I gained extensive knowledge in RF systems, along with hands-on experience in the laboratory and using software tools such as ADS, CST, Genesys, Spice, and Altium Designer.

👨‍🏫 My experience as a Teaching Assistant in Electromagnetism at the University of Buenos Aires allowed me to deepen my technical skills in areas such as Maxwell's equations, microwave technology, transmission lines, and antennas, as well as develop the ability to effectively explain and convey my ideas to others.

🕵️‍♂️ Lately, I have developed a strong interest in Software Defined Radio (SDR) and its applications. I actively explore this field through personal projects and continuous learning. I am excited to leverage my RF expertise to contribute to the advancement of SDR technology and its integration into cutting-edge communication systems.

🚀 Driven by a passion for technology and a commitment to excellence, I am a dedicated professional with a problem-solving mindset and a collaborative approach. I thrive in challenging environments and constantly seek personal and professional growth.
