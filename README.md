I am an experienced RF Design Engineer with a deep passion for the aerospace industry. With a solid background in Electronic Engineering and a strong expertise in RF technology, I have dedicated my career to designing and analyzing RF electronic equipment for satellite communications ðŸ›°.

During my time at INVAP, a renowned aerospace company, I have played a pivotal role in developing advanced K/Ka-band Down/Up-converters for SmallGeo SATCOM, as well as designing high-performance parallel coupled filters at Ka-band frequencies for the flexible payload development of GSATCOM.

With a Master's thesis focused on the design, implementation, and characterization of an analog front-end for a versatile UWB receiver, I have gained extensive knowledge in RF systems and acquired practical experience in utilizing leading tools such as ADS, CST, Genesys, Spice, and Altium Designer.

My experience as an Electromagnetism Teaching Assistant at the University of Buenos Aires has further honed my understanding of Maxwell equations, microwave technology, transmission lines, and antennas.

In addition to my expertise in RF, I am actively exploring the exciting field of Software Defined Radio (SDR) and its wide-ranging applications through personal projects and continuous learning. I am enthusiastic about leveraging my RF background to contribute to the advancement of SDR technology and its seamless integration into cutting-edge communication systems.

Motivated by my love for technology and a relentless pursuit of excellence, I approach every challenge with a problem-solving mindset and thrive in collaborative environments. I am committed to constant growth, both personally and professionally, to stay at the forefront of the ever-evolving industry ðŸš€.
